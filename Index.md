  - Test end-to-end communication and troubleshoot any issues.

### 6: Developing Kafka Producers in PHP/Laravel
- **Designing Kafka Producers in Laravel**
- **Integrating AVRO Serialization with Producers**
- **Best Practices for Kafka Producers**
- **Hands-On Activity: Implementing a Producer with AVRO**
  - Extend the Laravel producer to serialize messages using AVRO.
  - Produce and inspect messages to ensure correct serialization.
  - Discuss how serialization impacts message size and performance.

### 7: Developing Kafka Consumers in PHP/Laravel
- **Designing Kafka Consumers in Laravel**
- **Message Handling and Processing Strategies**
- **Error Handling and Consumer Reliability**
- **Hands-On Activity: Implementing a Consumer with AVRO Deserialization**
  - Set up a consumer to deserialize AVRO messages.
  - Process the data in some way, such as logging or saving to a database.
  - Handle errors gracefully and ensure the consumer can recover from failures.

### 8: Managing and Using the Schema Registry
- **Role of the Schema Registry in Kafka Architectures**
- **Managing Schemas and Versions**
- **Schema Evolution and Compatibility Management**
- **Hands-On Activity: Schema Versioning and Compatibility Testing**
  - Update an existing AVRO schema to add a new field with default values.
  - Register the new version of the schema in the Schema Registry.
  - Produce messages using both versions and consume them to test compatibility.

### 9: Advanced Kafka: Partitioning, Replication, and Reliability
- **Understanding Kafka’s Partitioning Mechanism**
- **Replication for Data Durability**
- **Ensuring High Availability and Fault Tolerance**
- **Hands-On Activity: Configuring and Testing Partitions and

 Replication**
  - Create a topic with multiple partitions and a high replication factor.
  - Produce messages to see how they are distributed across partitions.
  - Simulate a broker failure and observe Kafka’s recovery process.

### 10: Kafka Security: Best Practices for Secure Messaging
- **Overview of Kafka Security Features**
- **Implementing SSL/TLS in Kafka**
- **Access Control with Kafka ACLs**
- **Hands-On Activity: Setting Up Secure Kafka Communication**
  - Configure SSL/TLS for Kafka brokers and clients.
