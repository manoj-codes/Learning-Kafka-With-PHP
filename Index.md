- **Setting Up Kafka Using Docker**
  - Install Docker and download Kafka using docker-compose files.
  - Execute docker-compose to start Kafka and Zookeeper.
  - Use CLI tools to create and list Kafka topics.
  - Produce and consume a test message to ensure the setup works.

### 3: Deep Dive into Kafka Producers and Consumers
- **Role and Functions of Kafka Producers**
- **Role and Functions of Kafka Consumers**
- **Understanding Consumer Groups and Offsets**
- **Creating Producers and Consumers in PHP**
  - Install `php-rdkafka` via Composer.
  - Write a simple producer script to send messages to Kafka.
  - Develop a consumer script to read messages and output to the console.
  - Execute scripts to validate the message flow.

### 4: Introduction to AVRO and Data Serialization
- **What is AVRO?**
- **Benefits of Using AVRO with Kafka**
- **Basics of AVRO Schemas**
- **Creating and Validating an AVRO Schema**
  - Define a simple AVRO schema for a user entity.
  - Use an online tool to validate the schema.
  - Register the schema with a Schema Registry and note the schema ID.

### 5: Setting Up Your Development Environment for Kafka and AVRO
- **Installing Kafka and AVRO Libraries in Laravel**
- **Configuring Kafka and AVRO in Laravel Environment**
- **Testing the Setup**
- **Producing and Consuming Messages**
  - Write a Laravel command to produce a message using an AVRO schema.
  - Implement a consumer in Laravel that reads and logs these messages.
  - Test end-to-end communication and troubleshoot any issues.

### 6: Developing Kafka Producers in PHP/Laravel
- **Designing Kafka Producers in Laravel**
- **Integrating AVRO Serialization with Producers**
- **Best Practices for Kafka Producers**
- **Implementing a Producer with AVRO**
  - Extend the Laravel producer to serialize messages using AVRO.
  - Produce and inspect messages to ensure correct serialization.
  - Discuss how serialization impacts message size and performance.

### 7: Developing Kafka Consumers in PHP/Laravel
- **Designing Kafka Consumers in Laravel**
- **Message Handling and Processing Strategies**
- **Error Handling and Consumer Reliability**
- **Implementing a Consumer with AVRO Deserialization**
  - Set up a consumer to deserialize AVRO messages.
  - Process the data in some way, such as logging or saving to a database.
  - Handle errors gracefully and ensure the consumer can recover from failures.

### 8: Managing and Using the Schema Registry
- **Role of the Schema Registry in Kafka Architectures**
- **Managing Schemas and Versions**
- **Schema Evolution and Compatibility Management**
- **Schema Versioning and Compatibility Testing**
  - Update an existing AVRO schema to add a new field with default values.
  - Register the new version of the schema in the Schema Registry.
  - Produce messages using both versions and consume them to test compatibility.

### 9: Advanced Kafka: Partitioning, Replication, and Reliability
- **Understanding Kafka’s Partitioning Mechanism**
- **Replication for Data Durability**
- **Ensuring High Availability and Fault Tolerance**
- **Configuring and Testing Partitions and Replication**
  - Create a topic with multiple partitions and a high replication factor.
  - Produce messages to see how they are distributed across partitions.
  - Simulate a broker failure and observe Kafka’s recovery process.

### 10: Kafka Security: Best Practices for Secure Messaging
- **Overview of Kafka Security Features**
- **Implementing SSL/TLS in Kafka**
- **Access Control with Kafka ACLs**
- **Setting Up Secure Kafka Communication**
  - Configure SSL/TLS for Kafka brokers and clients.
  - Set up ACLs to control access to topics.
  - Test secure message production and consumption to validate configurations.

### 11: Monitoring and Troubleshooting Kafka Applications
- **Tools for Monitoring Kafka**
- **Key Kafka Metrics to Monitor**
- **Common Kafka Issues and Troubleshooting Techniques**
- **Setting Up Monitoring and Conducting a Load Test**
  - Install and configure Prometheus and Grafana.
  - Set up dashboards to visualize Kafka metrics.
  - Generate a load to stress test the system and observe the metrics.

### 12: Case Study: Implementing an Event-Driven System in PHP/Laravel with Kafka and AVRO
- **Review of the Case Study Architecture**
- **Key Implementation Details**
- **Lessons Learned and Best Practices**
- **Extending and Integrating Features**
  - Identify a new feature or microservice to add to the case study.
  - Implement this feature using Laravel, Kafka, and AVRO.
  - Integrate and test the new service within the existing architecture.

### 13: Workshop: Hands-on Kafka and AVRO
